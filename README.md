# quantum_computing
This project was made to help me learn about the foundations of quantum computing. It assigns qubits or quantum bits to each "DNA-base" such as A, T, C, or G. Some of these qubits are superpositioned where it isn't a ket 0 or ket 1, and is in fact normalized already. Then, it outputs each qubit as part of the string of "DNA" input.
